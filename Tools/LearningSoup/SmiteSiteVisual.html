    <div>Alpha Test Status</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>We philosophically believe that the best way to make a game like this is side-by-side with the community. We
        want your feedback and things in the game will change depending on these tests.</li>
    <li>For this first alpha test we want to focus specifically on core combat gameplay, and the technical systems that
        ship the game to players and host online matches. </li>
    <li>Feedback will be collected via surveys, please fill them out after playing a few matches, we would love to hear
        every like and dislike you have. Be specific as possible and don’t hold back!</li>
    <li>Streaming, Recording, Screenshots, and discussion on all forms of social media is allowed for this test. We will
        be monitoring public discussions for feedback as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alpha Tests have varying degrees of permanent progress or ownership. This includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Player Names<ul>
            <li>All in-game names will be steam display names or console platform account names. Duplicate names can
                exist in this test. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>God Ownership<ul>
            <li>All gods will be unlocked, regardless of founder's packs or divine legacy status. This will change in
                the future and gods will need to be unlocked through various systems. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Skin Ownership<ul>
            <li>Skins (except Cacodemon 2 Ymir) in this test will accurately reflect player ownership based on Founder’s
                Pack and Divine Legacy Unlocking.</li>
            <li>All players will be able to use Cacodemon 2 Ymir during the Alpha period, but it will be restricted to
                Founder’s Edition purchasers once SMITE 2 enters Beta.</li>
            <li>No other cosmetics except for Skins exist in this alpha test.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Account Progress<ul>
            <li>There is no form of Player Level, God Mastery, or other persistent progression in this alpha test</li>
            <li>In future alpha tests this might exist, but will be Reset </li>
            <li>MMR will be working and gained/lost per match, but will also be likely to reset for future alpha tests.

    <div>Gameplay</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Design Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>SMITE 1 has been built upon for 10+ years. We aim to design SMITE 2 to be able to progress for another 10+
        years. </li>
    <li>We want to keep the core gameplay of SMITE 2 similar to SMITE 1. It's been successful for us, it's familiar to
        our players, and it aligns with the goals of a sequel game. </li>
    <li>We also want to introduce a large variety of new designs.</li>
    <li>The new game and the new technology create a unique opportunity for rebalancing SMITE and introducing new
        mechanics in ways that SMITE 1 couldn’t support. </li>
    <li>Throughout the alpha period we will be delivering a strong foundation of familiar and proven designs, while also
        experimenting heavily with bold new balance adjustments. </li>
    <li>Increasing Player Creativity is our number one goal for Gameplay Design in SMITE 2. To us, this means more build
        variety, more role flexibility, and higher skill ceilings.</li>
    <li>SMITE 2 has the potential to be a deeper game with more competitive potential than
        SMITE 1, while still maintaining the fun and familiar core combat that our community loves. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat System Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Strength (STR) and Intelligence (INT)<ul>
            <li>All gods can now build all items. </li>
            <li>All gods can now build these 2 different stats that will have different effects on scaling their
                abilities and basic attacks.</li>
            <li>STR is generally used for Basic Attack Damage and Ability Damage.</li>
            <li>INT is generally used for Ability Damage and Ability Utility Effects.</li>
            <li>Each effect in each ability will be clearly labeled to indicate what type of stats they scale from.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Magical and Physical Damage (and Protections)<ul>
            <li>Any god can now deal Magical and/or Physical Damage. </li>
            <li>Many SMITE 2 gods deal both types within the same kit, regardless of item build. </li>
            <li>Each instance of damage in each ability will be clearly labeled to display if it deals magical or
                physical damage. </li>
            <li>Abilities that scale mostly or only from STR generally deal physical damage.</li>
            <li>Abilities that scale mostly or only form INT generally deal magical damage</li>
            <li>Many abilities scale from a combination of STR and INT at the same time, and are specifically chosen to
                deal only magical or physical damage for thematic reasons or balance reasons. </li>
            <li>Basic Attacks can deal Magical or Physical damage depending on the god, but all basic attacks in the
                game currently scale at 100% STR + 20% INT.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Magical and Physical Protection<ul>
            <li>Magical and Physical protections will work just how they did in SMITE 1.</li>
            <li>Magical Protection decreases Magical Damage and Physical Protection decreases Physical Damage. </li>
            <li>The formula for mitigating damage through protections is unchanged. 100/(100+x)</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that most enemies will be able to deal both types of damage, and itemize accordingly.</li>
            <li>Even a god building all STR can still deal Magical Damage, when you take or deal damage a symbol will
                appear next to the damage numbers that conveys the type. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cooldown Rate<ul>
            <li>Cooldown Reduction % has been
                changed to Cooldown Rate </li>
            <li>Cooldown Rate does not map directly 1:1 to % reduction, it has diminishing returns the more you get.
                Example:</li>
            <li>At 10 CDRate, my effective
                CDReduction is 9%</li>
            <li>At 50 CDRate, my effective CDReduction is 33%</li>
            <li>At 120 CDRate, my effective CDReduction is 54.5%</li>
            <li>This also uses the 100/(100+x) formula.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Lifesteal<ul>
            <li>Lifesteal is now just Lifesteal, this stat automatically applies to ALL damage dealt, whether it be
                magical, physical, basic attack, or ability.</li>
            <li>There is no reduction for AoE abilities. </li>
            <li>It applies at a 100% effectiveness of the amount to enemy gods.</li>
            <li>But it applies at 33% effectiveness to all minions, jungle monsters, and jungle bosses.<ul>
                    <li>So 30% lifesteal<ul>
                            <li>30% of the damage dealt to gods is healed.</li>
                            <li>And 10% of the damage dealt to everything else is healed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Penetration<ul>
            <li>Flat Pen is not currently available as a stat on any item, and there are no plans to reintroduce it.
            </li>
            <li>A similar effect can be achieved through Protection Reduction Debuffs though, which are available in a
                few select places. </li>
            <li>% Pen is still available on items. So are effects like Qin’s which doesn’t have actual Pen, but is still
                anti-tank in its own way. </li>
            <li>Physical Penetration benefits abilities that deal physical damage.</li>
            <li>Magical Penetration benefits abilities that deal magical damage. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Critical Strike<ul>
            <li>Critical Strikes include all of the modern smoothing formulas that SMITE 1 had</li>
            <li>Critical Strikes in SMITE 2 hit for 1.75x damage, With the Deathbringer item boosting that to 2x damage.
            </li>
            <li>All gods can now buy Critical Strike Chance and can Critically Strike on their basic attacks.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Movement<ul>
            <li>Just like in SMITE 1 the Backpedal is -40%. Strafe is -20%.Melee penalty is -35%. Ranged Penalty is -50%
            </li>
            <li>Gods no longer gain movement speed over the first 7 levels.</li>
            <li>All gods are full speed from level 1</li>
            <li>There are no boots style items in the game, movement speed only comes from full priced tier 3s, usually
                under specific conditions only. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Diminishing Returns (of CC duration)<ul>
            <li>This is mostly unchanged from SMITE 1</li>
            <li>Hard CC Provides 1 Stack of DR</li>
            <li>Displacement CC Provides 2 Stacks of DR</li>
            <li>Each Stack of DR Provides 20% Crowd Control Reduction of the duration</li>
            <li>Cap of 80% Reduction, but this cannot reduce effects to lower than 0.5s</li>
            <li>Stacks up to 4 times, Last 15s</li>
            <li>One change from SMITE 2 is that abilities can now apply only 1 or 2 stacks of DR. In SMITE 1 some
                abilities could apply 3 stacks based on multiple CC effects in a row</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Displacement CC<ul>
            <li>All knockbacks, knock ups, pushes, pulls, grabs will now be described as “Displacement” CC effect
                instead of “Knockbacks”</li>
            <li>The term Knockback often confused players in SMITE 1 because it sounds more specific than it actually
                was. </li>
            <li>This is a hard CC effect</li>
            <li>Abilities that displace will describe the direction and style of displacement in their long description
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Impede CC<ul>
            <li>“Player made walls” and other blocking areas will use the term “Impedes” to describe what types of other
                gods or characters it blocks</li>
            <li>Phantom effect will grant “Impediment Immunity”</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Health Shields<ul>
            <li>Health shields now stack in SMITE 2</li>
            <li>Damage will be taken from the shield with the shortest duration first</li>
            <li>Shields will be able to be gained, lost, independently over time, and treated as if they were each
                unique shields, even though the UI currently only displays them as 1 total shield bar.</li>
        </ul>

<p><strong>Game Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Front End UI<ul>
            <li>This UI is in a mostly temporary state, and is intended to serve the core functional purposes of playing
                SMITE.<ul>
                    <li>Learning about Gods.</li>
                    <li>Getting into a party.</li>
                    <li>Playing a game through queues or custom games.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Practice Mode<ul>
            <li>Navigate to the Gods section of the front end, select a god, then use the “Enter Practice” button to
                load into our test map with the god.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New Player Experience<ul>
            <li>We expect most alpha testers will have already played a good amount of SMITE, and we are prioritizing
                core gameplay systems, so there will not be any tutorial systems in the game at this time.</li>
            <li>This document will serve as the primary source of gameplay information.</li>
            <li>Please follow SMITE socials for external guides, tips, and explanations.</li>
            <li>New Player Experience will become a huge priority for the team in future stages of development.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Queueing <ul>
            <li>Pre Match Lobby will not immediately close if someone disconnects after selecting a god, they will have
                time to reconnect to the lobby or the match</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Conquest Roles<ul>
            <li>Role Queue and assigned roles are not ready yet.</li>
            <li>Pre Match Lobby will have a function for players to select and trade roles.</li>
            <li>We highly encourage using this, even if you already hovered or locked your god!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pre Match Lobby Information<ul>
            <li>Players will be able to read their gods high-level summary, as well as individual ability descriptions
                in the match lobby.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Auto Buy<ul>
            <li>All players will br prompted with an Auto Buy option at the start of each match.</li>
            <li>Each god will have 2-3 different Auto Builds players can choose from, this can be changed each game.
            </li>
            <li>Once a build is selected, that build will automatically progress whenever the player returns to base.
            </li>
            <li>The current auto build will be disabled for the rest of the match if ANY single item is bought or sold
                manually. This is due to the early development state of the system.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

            <li>Surrender functionality does exist in this test.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Conquest Help Tips<ul>
            <li>As you start the match and move through the map, help tips will pop up
                to explain new mechanics and rewards.</li>
            <li>These can be disabled via the settings menu.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Player Behavior<ul>
            <li>This is an alpha test, things might go wrong, players might be confused. We encourage everyone to just
                “play on” as much as they can. Try to finish matches or use the surrender function. Try to focus on
                exploring the new gameplay even if your team mates or opponents are struggling.</li>
            <li>MMR will be reset multiple times in the future.</li>
            <li>Deserter Penalty will be in effect for this public weekend.</li>
            <li>VGS, Pings, and Emotes will also have built in spam protection.</li>

<div class='\"wrapped-header\"'>
    <div>Conquest</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Design Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>We plan to deepen the systems that make up Conquest and add more impact to the choices a player makes in a
        match. This has only just begun at this stage of development, and has a lot of room to expand. </li>
    <li>Aim to keep roles as flexible and creative as possible throughout the Alpha and Beta stages. We want players to
        have a significant impact over what the metagame looks like. </li>
    <li>In order to achieve the goal above, we are currently not creating items that force gods into specific playstyles
        or roles.</li>
    <li>This is something we are open to adjusting later, possibly by creating starter items for roles that need it most
        like jungle or support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tower System</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bounties<ul>
            <li>Each tower’s health is divided into segments, separated by a marker on their health bar. </li>
            <li>Reducing a tower’s health bar segment will cause it
                to drop two gold bounties that players can pick up for 75 Gold.</li>
            <li>The last bounty on each tower is worth extra gold, and is only granted to the team that reaches it
                first. This is specially marked by a different icon on their health bar.<ul>
                    <li>For example, if the Order team reduces the Chaos T1 tower’s health below the last bounty, it
                        will grant 125 Gold. If the Chaos team then decided to reduce the Order T1 tower’s health below
                        the last bounty, they would only get the normal bounty of 75 Gold.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This is essentially a race where both teams are trying to be the first to reach the special bounty on
                each tower. </li>
            <li>Early game pressure on tower’s are rewarded with more gold, which can then lead to items being built
                slightly faster.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minions</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Minions can be executed with a Basic Attack once they fall below 25% HP</li>
    <li>Minotaurs<ul>
            <li>Periodically spawn as an extra Minion in the wave. These are tanky siege minions that can deal heavy
                damage to enemy Towers<ul>
                    <li>Spawn every 6 waves, starting at 2:30</li>
                    <li>At 20:00, they begin spawning every 5 waves</li>
                    <li>At 25:00, they begin spawning every 4 waves</li>
                    <li>At 30:00, they begin spawning every 3 waves</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>XP and Gold Rewards<ul>
            <li>Melee<ul>
                    <li>Grants 50 XP and 21 Gold</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ranged<ul>
                    <li>Grants 30 XP and 15 Gold</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Minotaur<ul>
                    <li>Grants 70 XP and 60 Gold</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All minion rewards increase by +5 XP and +0.5 Gold every 3 minutes</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Infamy System</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Jungle
        Camps<ul>
            <li>Each team now gains infamy with every jungle creature they defeat.<ul>
                    <li>Fire Giant and Gold Fury are excluded.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Gaining Infamy levels up jungle camps on your side of the map, yielding better rewards when killing
                them.</li>
            <li>Killing camps on your opponent’s side also denies the enemy team of that Infamy.</li>
            <li>Each creature falls into a specific category that rewards different amounts of Infamy:<ul>
                    <li>Large creatures grant 40 Infamy.</li>
                    <li>Small creatures grant 15 Infamy.</li>
                    <li>Very small creatures grant 5 Infamy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Upon reaching a new Infamy level, the jungle camp will increase in Infamy rank and start granting new
                rewards.<ul>
                    <li>The Infamy level thresholds are as follows:<ul>
                            <li>Level 1: All camps start here</li>
                            <li>Level 2: 210 Infamy</li>
                            <li>Level 3: 560 Infamy</li>
                            <li>Level 4: 980 Infamy</li>

<ul>
    <li>Invader’s curse has been removed in SMITE 2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interactive Map Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In SMITE 2 the gods can now “Interact” with objectives on the map.</li>
    <li>Instead of killing something or standing somewhere you can press a button to capture an objective or begin a
        specific action.</li>
    <li>This button will be your JUMP button. When in an interactable area instead of jumping, this button will begin
        the interaction.</li>
    <li>Channeled interactions can be canceled by attacking, moving, or taking damage.</li>
    <li>Interactive Objectives in this test are<ul>
            <li>Jungle Buff Pickups</li>
            <li>Gold Caches</li>
            <li>The Warhorn</li>

            <li>Fire Giant Door</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jungle Buffs</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In SMITE 2 players will need to use the interact key to pick up Jungle Buffs</li>
    <li>While you have a Jungle Buff, you can Interact with another buff of a different type to replace your current one
    </li>
    <li>Picking up a lower level buff of the same type will refresh your current buff’s duration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gold Cache</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Locations<ul>
            <li>To the side of each lane is a small gold cache that can be picked up with the interact key.<ul>
                    <li>Picking it up grants 30 team gold.</li>
                    <li>Respawns every 120s.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warhorn</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Capturing this new
        objective in Solo lane will award 25 Gold to each member of your team and upgrade your next wave of minions into
        Champions for all 3 lanes</li>
    <li>Champion Minions<ul>
            <li>Damage taken from enemy Gods and Minions is reduced by 25%</li>
            <li>+2 Power (for every 2 minutes of match time, up to a maximum of +20)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Interacting with the Warhorn once will begin capturing it for your team. While capturing is in progress, the
        enemy can Interact to halt your progress and begin capturing for their own team.</li>
    <li>The Warhorn unlocks at 1:30, takes 40 seconds to capture, and has a 90 second cooldown period before it can be
        captured again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teleporters</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Locations<ul>
            <li>The duo and solo lanes now have a new side area that holds a teleporter next to each team’s T1 tower.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Usage<ul>
            <li>Players need to press the interact button to use the teleporter.</li>
            <li>Using this teleporter will transport you horizontally across the map to the opposing lane.<ul>
                    <li>If I use the teleporter next to Order’s T1 duo tower, then I would end up at the teleporter next
                        to Order’s T1 solo tower.</li>
                    <li>Upon teleporting, players receive two effects:<ul>
                            <li>A slight speed boost.</li>
                            <li>A 30s cooldown
                                that prevents teleporter usage.</li>
                        </ul>

                                up and aims at its current target. It then slams its fist down, and displaces any

                                arcing magma balls that fly outwards in random directions and deal damage upon landing.

<p><strong>Design Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Flexible Systems, Unique Kits. <ul>
            <li>We want each god to be unique in the abilities it has. Each god should bring something new to their
                team, be it one large feature, or a unique combination of smaller ones. </li>
            <li>At the same time, the base stats, items, and other systems of the game should support as much role
                flexibility as possible. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Something new to explore<ul>
            <li>In SMITE 2 we aim
                to bring some new component to each god we bring over from SMITE 1. This can range from entire ability
                reworks, to balance level changes that promote big playstyle changes - like
                STR ADC Zeus or Crit Ymir. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>God System Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In SMITE 2 gods will no longer be labeled by “Class” or confined to constraints within that class. Gods will be
        a sum of their parts, and could have combinations of kits and base stats that would not fit into a SMITE 1 Class
        definition, Which SMITE 1 already had a few of - leading to constant confusion and debate</li>
    <li>Base Stats of all gods are generally closer together than in SMITE 1, making the item build and the unique
        features of the god’s ability kit more important in determining which roles they can be successful in. </li>
    <li>With no classes, gods will instead be defined by their key properties<ul>
            <li>Ranged vs Melee Basic Attack</li>
            <li>Basic Attack Damage<ul>
                    <li>Shows a scale 1-5 on how much basic attack damage the god can output Derived from Base STR and
                        kit features. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ability Damage<ul>
                    <li>Shows a scale 1-5 on how much ability damage the god can output. Accounts for Ability Damage and
                        Scaling.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Defenses<ul>

<p><strong>God Ability Text</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>To read your God’s abilities in game:<ul>
            <li> On PC: Use ALT + Mouse hover each ability</li>
            <li>On Consoles: Use DPad Up then LB / RB or L1 / R1 to move to each ability</li>
            <li>Selecting your God’s Avatar Image will display the Passive Ability information. Each Ability icon will
                display that abilitie’s information</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Short and Long ability descriptions:<ul>
            <li>Each God ability will now have a short version and a long version of the ability text.</li>
            <li>All abilities will default to the short version.</li>
            <li>Short versions are intended to be as short as possible to convey only the key gameplay effects of the
                ability and show the key scaling stats.</li>
            <li>Use Right Click, Y, or Triangle to toggle between these modes.</li>
            <li>Long descriptions will reveal much more information about the ability.</li>
        </ul>

<p><strong>Full God Kits</strong></p>
<p>“We want these update notes to be as informative as possible, so we are sharing the full god kits. These might be
    hard to quickly scan and notice changes from SMITE 1, though. Dev notes for each god will be used to highlight these
    new features and give some explanations to our thought process on why the changes were made. One important thing to
    remember is that the base stats on gods and items in SMITE 2 have changed, so even changes that look like nerfs
    relative to SMITE 1 might still be very powerful in SMITE 2. ” </p>
<p><strong>Hecate</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Hecate be released in a future alpha update. Community discussion and closed testing yielded feedback that the
        goddess needed more dev time in order to further deliver on her mechanics and themes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anhur</strong></p>
<p>“Enfeeble now requires 2 stacks to reach full effectiveness. Shifting Sands now has a stronger slow area closer to
    the pillar, and can be manually reactivated to be destroyed early. It can also be placed behind him. Desert Fury has
    been reworked for more specific pacing and timing for a long range, high damage ultimate. Anhur’s changes are geared
    toward leaning into his existing strengths of Crowd Control and hard hitting abilities.”</p>

<p><strong>Athena</strong></p>
<p>“Preemptive Strike now charges up much faster. Defender of Olympus places a shield on the target instead of a
    Mitigation Buff and Athena will teleport to the location even if the target dies. Our goal with this adjustment is
    to make it more often the correct choice to save a teammate in danger and limit feeling like you have to teleport to
    healthy targets to ensure you get value out of the ultimate. </p>
<p>Athena has always had a unique role in being considered a true support, but also being a powerful burst damage
    jungler. The change to base stats in SMITE 2 max Athena more flexible than ever, supported even further by her
    ultimate being better at rescuing low HP targets, and being a guaranteed global movement ability.”</p>

<p>“Getting drunk now gains a protection multiplier buff, encouraging Bacchus to build tanky instead of giving him
    mitigation which allowed for overpowered hybrid builds that dominated non-Conquest for years. Chug has been reworked
    to have an entirely new self effect that causes your next basic attack to hit harder, scaling off your protections.
    Bacchus’ changes are designed around making sure he can build tanky and be a successful frontline support.” </p>

<p>“This Carry will be getting some interesting shifts for SMITE 2’s STR and INT system. Shifter of Seasons will have a
    variety of new ways to scale using INT for more utility, and his Bramble Blast and Wild Hunt abilities will deal
    magical damage and scale with INT. This helps balance him in a way that prevents him from doing everything from the
    carry role, something that often required him to be overnerfed in SMITE 1. Cernunnos isn't aimed to not be so full
    INT that he works better in mid. Instead, he will be SMITE 2’s premier hybrid damage carry.”</p>

    definitely still be played as a traditional carry. </p>
<p>Placing and detonating Weaves is now a bigger focus of her kit. Detonating Weaves provides a stacking buff. Her

<p><strong>Odin</strong></p>
<p>“Odin leans more into his mastery of runes, using Intelligence to augment his abilities in unique ways. His Raven
    Shout Shield and pulse damage from Gungnir’s Might scale utilizing intelligence, giving him a very tanky and
    pressure damaging playstyle. The core of the Bird Bomb combo however is still as strong as ever when leaning into
    the more traditional Strength based gameplay. Odin’s flexibility to frontline or support his team is further
    amplified by a wide array of utility active items that his kit really lets him lean into.”</p>

<p><strong>Ymir</strong></p>

    to launch himself forward to gain speed, or launch enemies toward him to put them in danger. He can reactivate this
    ability to cancel it early, and can even spawn it behind him for easy launches.” </p>

<p><strong>Zeus</strong></p>
<p>“Zeus has undergone a significant rework, bringing back aspects of his initial version from Smite 1. Detonate is his
    iconic ability, and building to 3 charges should be a rewarding moment for Zeus and a moment of terror for whom will
    be smited. Aegis Assault made it easier to apply charges from safety, limiting how potent we could make Detonate.
    Thunderclap has replaced Aegis Assault, providing an instant AoE burst around Zeus and providing a large Attack
    Speed and Movement Speed stim. Now Zeus has to rely on his skillshot Basic Attacks and Chain Lightnings to quickly
    apply charges or put himself at risk with Thunderclap, allowing Detonate to be more powerful.</p>
<p>Detonate now stuns at max charges (an old throwback!) and no longer consumes charges, allowing Zeus to continue to
    benefit from the amplified Basic Attack damage. These aspects together make his gameplay goals clear, but allows for
    a lot of flexibility on how you approach that goal. Pure INT Zeus will burst enemies just as hard as you are used
    to, but Tanky Cooldown Zeus or Inhand Zeus are now potent additional options! </p>
<p>We also included a new UI element on enemy god health bars that track charge counts. This makes it easier to keep
    track of your current charge count, especially when the gods model is obscured or behind a wall.”</p>

    <li>Significantly reduce item stat bloat. </li>
    <li>Create strong trade-offs in build choices. </li>
    <li>Create impactful passive and active effects. </li>
    <li>The main goal for Alpha 1 items was to ensure that all god/role combinations have a complete build + flex
        options supported.</li>
    <li>We are excited to continue to make more intense and exciting items that can really change the gameplay of a god
        or match in SMITE 2!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Item System Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>General<ul>
            <li>All Items have temporary placeholder visual FX and audio effects - for both actives and passives.</li>
            <li>Many items
                have placeholder icon art, mostly repurposed from SMITE 1 - but many items have new updated art as well.
            </li>
            <li>All items will be purchasable by all gods. </li>
            <li>Some Items will now be marked “Unique”. Players are allowed to have duplicates of non-unique items in
                their inventory at the same time. You cannot have duplicates of Unique items. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SMITE 2 Items will use a component based system instead of a tree based system that SMITE 1 used.<ul>
            <li>This means that Tier 3 items will be built from a combination of T1 and T2 items plus an additional gold
                cost, like crafting recipe, instead of being a linear upgrade.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The main advantages of this system are that<ul>
            <li>Stats can now have a gold efficient value that is uniformly applied to all items with that stat,
                allowing for more consistent item power. </li>
            <li>Players will now have more options as they upgrade their items. In SMITE 1 it was possible to start
                purchasing items in the “wrong” physical power tree, limiting your options. In SMITE 2, the T1 STR item
                will be usable as a component in every other strength item in the game. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ward<ul>
            <li>All players will start each match with a vision ward in a unique slot. </li>
            <li>Wards function mostly just like they did in SMITE 1, they are invisible to enemies and reveal enemies
                who walk through their radius. </li>
            <li>Wards cannot be purchased with gold, they are instead placed with this slot and a cooldown.</li>
            <li>This slot can be upgraded to a Sentry Ward for the rest of the game on the same cooldown for a one time
                gold purchase. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Purification Beads<ul>
            <li>All players will start each match with purification beads in a unique slot. </li>
            <li>Purification Beads is an active effect that cleanses you
                of all forms of Crowd Control.</li>
            <li>This effect cannot be upgraded or changed into any other type of effect. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Item Slots<ul>
            <li>All of your passive items, active items, and consumables go into your primary 6 item slot inventory.
            </li>
            <li>Inventory will default to auto sorting consumables and actives to the first slots, to make sure those
                key/button bindings are most consistently used. </li>
            <li>You can also manually re-order your inventory by dragging items from one slot to another, or following
                the console button prompts. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Active Items<ul>
            <li>SMITE 2 now has items with active effects that will fire with a button press. These items are auto
                sorted to the first slots of your inventory when purchased. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Passive Items <ul>
            <li>Many SMITE 2 items have traditional passive effects like they do in SMITE 2. </li>
            <li>There are also passive items that have no actual passive effect, these items have additional stats to
                make up for this. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<p><strong>Issues Process</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In order to ship an online game to multiple platforms, there has to
        be a large window of time dedicated to internal QA and a process known as “Certification”.</li>
    <li>During this time we have to keep the game as unchanged as possible, in order for it to be thoroughly tested by
        our teams, as well as teams at Sony and Microsoft.</li>
    <li>We find and track many many bugs, but can only fix the most critical ones.</li>
    <li>Much more content and features beyond what will be visible in this test have already been added to SMITE 2 in
        our dev environment, and will begin testing and certification soon for future tests.</li>
    <li>Many bugs have already been fixed in this next version as well, but we still encourage players in the Alpha test
        to report any and all issues they see. </li>
    <li>In reporting your bugs, please be as specific as possible, show how or describe how the issue occurred (if
        possible), and be understanding of the fact that we might have noticed or fixed some of these already.</li>
    <li>We are all working together as a team through this Alpha to make SMITE 2 the best it can be. Thank you for your
        participation! </li>

    <li>Some features/gameplay are in an early state, and may be missing functionality or have limited functionality.
    </li>
    <li>Keep in mind, we are rebuilding virtually everything from scratch. If something isn't in yet, the answer as to
        why is likely “we haven't gotten to it yet.” </li>
    <li>This is not a complete list of upcoming features, just a selection of ones we feel are most likely to be
        discussed during Alpha.</li>
    <li>Front End UI<ul>
            <li>The visual presentation of the Front End UI is in very early stages and will change drastically over
                time.</li>
            <li>God browser is in progress and is missing features such as rotating models, viewing base stats, and
                more. </li>
            <li>Loading Screen is working as designed, but missing lots of art and customization features. </li>
            <li>God mastery and the new Ascension system are in progress.</li>
            <li>Voice Chat is in progress.</li>
            <li>Text Chat is being assessed for implementation after Voice Chat. </li>
            <li>Player In Game Names will currently be the same as their Platform names (Steam, Xbox, PS, Epic) and
                duplicates will be allowed. In the future we plan to implement “Legacy Names” which will allow players
                to display their SMITE 1 legacy name plus an emblem to prove it is a legacy name. </li>
            <li>Role Aptitude: Gods will have data driven stats revealed to players in the game UI that shows the
                percentage of roles they are played in. This is in progress for a future version. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Spectator System<ul>
            <li>This is already functional in this first Alpha! It is free cam only, and has very little UI or features,
                but it is available to test in custom games, and will be improved to meet the basic needs of a
                competitive tournament broadcast as soon as possible. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Core Combat<ul>
            <li>General feel and functionality on abilities, basic attacks, and targeting will be continually improved.
            </li>
            <li>All Item stats have no caps at this time, for this reason, some stats are present on less items than
                might be expected. </li>
            <li>Player Inventory in game will soon be able to be sorted or rearranged manually.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Settings<ul>
            <li>We will be continually improving performance FPS and Ping in future versions. </li>
            <li>Full console rebind functionality is in progress.</li>
            <li>Individual Ability casting settings are in progress, and would be accessible via settings menu if they
                come in before or without a K screen.</li>
            <li>Additional reticle, targeting, and highlight settings are in progress.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>HUD<ul>
            <li>HUD Art and layout will be updated continually.</li>
            <li>The Accolade and Announcer systems are in progress and will be updated continually.</li>
            <li>Damage Numbers are in progress and will be updated continually.</li>
            <li>The Item Store has improvements in progress and will be updated continually.</li>
            <li>HUD Editor is in progress and is moving toward launch in a later Alpha or early Beta.</li>
            <li>T Screen (Top Stats/Combat Log) Is a high priority and is in progress.</li>
            <li>Y Screen (Death Recap) is lower priority than T screen, but will begin development soon. </li>
            <li>K Screen (Ability Screen) is lower priority, as abilities can already be viewed in game, but is still
                being considered. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>This is not a fully comprehensive list of known issues. Just the ones that are most likely to affect gameplay in
        this first Alpha test.</li>
    <li>UI<ul>
            <li>The “True Alpha” intro video is unskippable. This is intended for now. Enjoy those precious moments with
                Travis and Ponpon. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>General<ul>
            <li>Players might move more slowly than intended after reconnecting to a match. This issue usually resolves
                itself after a short amount of time. </li>
            <li>God Ability Descriptions or Item Descriptions might include typos or numerical errors </li>
            <li>Voice packs are missing lines or have lines mixed up.</li>
            <li>VGS Buttons still register their gameplay effects, and will cause you to move while using VGS. Be
                careful of VGS while recalling</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Conquest<ul>
            <li>Conquest Towers are missing visual stages of destruction and outro destruction visuals. </li>
            <li>Wards are using temporary models. </li>
            <li>Ward vision area is not visible on the mini map.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>HUD<ul>
            <li>Damage numbers are not visible if you turn your camera so that they are offscreen. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Items<ul>
            <li>ALL item effects in game (buffs, debuffs, hit areas, aoe areas, etc) are using temporary visual FX and
                audio FX, and will be updated in the future. </li>
            <li>A few items are not sorted correctly in alphabetical order. </li>
            <li>Many items have not had their icon art updated yet. </li>
            <li>Blinking Amulet is currently allowing the teleport to be triggered in combat or even while
                firing/channeling an ability. This is not our final intent and the item will be removed from future
                Alpha tests to be reassessed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Gods<ul>
            <li>General<ul>
                    <li>Basic attacks can temporarily become unresponsive after rapidly tapping a single ability on
                        normal cast mode. Using another ability usually resolves the situation. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Anubis<ul>
                    <li>Has no passive

                    <li>Plague of Locusts visual FX can linger longer than intended</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Athena<ul>
                    <li>Has not had updated ability icons yet.</li>
                    <li>Can get stuck in walls if teleporting to a target right as they leap over walls. If you get
                        stuck in this way, you can use the menu to leave the game and then reconnect, which should send
                        you back to your base. </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Loki’s Ultimate is missing a few features. It does not cripple gods on the first hit yet, and it
